# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This application is a mashup of different pages, hobbies, ideas, and intended to be a sandbox to learn Front-end frameworks, libraries, APIs.

## Pages

### Recommendation page

Grew up in Portland Oregon. I enjoy exploring new restaurants, coffee shops, and parks. I like to host people when they come into town. People always ask me for recommendations, but I always forget and have trouble recalling on the spot.

I created this page to solve this issue and make traveling easier for friends/family in town.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Currently WIP, would like to integrate react-testing-library for user oriented component testing.
May add Sonarqube for quality and cypress for end-to-end testing.
